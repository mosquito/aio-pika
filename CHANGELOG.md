The bulk of the changes are related to how the library entities are now
interconnected. In previous versions of `aio_pika.Channel` instances not
contains a link to the `aio_pika.Connection` instances for now is contains it.

While I don't want custom code to work directly with the `aiormq.Channel`
instance, this was a public API and I should warn you about the change here.
The `aio_pika.Channel.channel` property is deprecated. Use
`aio_pika.Channel.get_underlay_chanel()` instead.
Now all library entities already use this method.


9.0.7
-----

* Update aiormq version

9.0.6
-----

* Amend Exchange.__repr__ to include class name #527
  Also switch to f-strings rather than %-formatting, modelled after
  Queue.__repr__.

* Improve type hints for `queue.get()` #542

9.0.5
-----

* Prevent 'Task exception was never retrieved' #524
  If future.exception() is not called (even on cancelled futures), it seems Python
  will then log 'Task exception was never retrieved'. Rewriting this logic
  slightly should hopefully achieve the same functionality while
  preventing the Python errors.
* Avoid implicitly depending on setuptools #526

9.0.4
-----

* fix README badge
* upgrade requirements

9.0.3
-----

* RPCs: Show exceptions on Host (remote side) #503

* change classifiers in pyproject.toml

9.0.0

The main goal of this release is the migration to `poetry` and stronger type
checking with mypy.

User code should remain compatible, just test it with mypy. The tests still
work the same, without public API changes, this indicates that your code
should work without changes, but does not prove it.

### Deprecations

* `aio_pika.message.HeaderProxy` - removed
* `aio_pika.message.header_converter` - removed

  been added to the public API, this does not break anything unless your
  code relies on the order of the arguments.

* improve typing in multiple library actors #478

8.1.0
-----

* Bump `aiormq~=6.4.0` with `connection blocking` feature

***Release notes***

In this release, there are many changes to the internal API and bug fixes
related to sudden disconnection and correct recovery after reconnection.

Unfortunately, the behavior that was in version 7.x was slightly affected.
It's the reason the major version has been updated.

The entire set of existing tests passes with minimal changes, therefore,
except for some minor changes in behavior, the user code should
work either without any modifications or with minimal changes,
such as replacing removed deprecated functions with alternatives.

This release has been already tested in a working environment, and now it seems
that we have completely resolved all the known issues related to
recovery after network failures.

***Changes***:

* Added tests for unexpected network connection resets and fixed
  many related problems.
* Added `UnderlayChannel` and `UnderlayConneciton`, this is `NamedTuple`s
  contains all connection and channel related properties.
  The `aiormq.Connection` and `aiormq.Channel` objects
  are now packaged in this `NamedTuple`s and can be atomically assigned
  to `aio_pika.Connection` and `aio_pika.Channel` objects.
  The main benefit is the not needed to add locks during the connection,
  in the best case, the container object is assigned to callee as usual,
  however, if something goes wrong during the connection, there is no need to
  clear something in `aio_pika.RobustConnection` or `aio_pika.RobustChannel`.
* An `__init__` method is now a part of abstract classes for most
  `aio_pika` entities.
* Removed explicit relations between `aio_pika.Channel`
  and `aio_pika.Connection`. Now you can't get a `aio_pika.Connection`
  instance from the `aio_pika.Channel` instance.
* Fixed a bug that caused the whole connection was closed when a timeout
  occurred in one of the channels, in case the channel was waiting for a
  response frame to an amqp-rpc call.
* Removed deprecated `add_close_callback` and `remove_close_callback` methods
  in `aio_pika.Channel`.
  Use `aio_pika.Channel.close_callbacks.add(callback, ...)` and
  `aio_pika.Channel.close_callbacks.remove(callback, ...)` instead.
* Fixed a bug in `aio_pika.RobustChannel` that caused `default_exchane`
  broken after reconnecting.
* The `publisher_confirms` property of `aio_pika.Channel` is public now.
* Function `get_exchange_name` is public now.
* Fixed an error in which the queue iterator could enter a deadlock state, with
  a sudden disconnection.
* The new entity `OneShotCallback` helps, for example, to call all the closing
  callbacks at the channel if the `Connection` was unexpectedly closed, and
  the channel closing frame did not come explicitly.


7.2.0
-----

* Make `aio_pika.patterns.rpc` more extendable.

7.1.0
-----

* Fixes in documentation

7.0.0
-----

This release brings support for a new version of `aiormq`, which is used as
a low-level driver for working with AMQP.

The release contains a huge number of changes in the internal structure of the
library, mainly related to type inheritance and abstract types, as well
as typehints checking via mypy.

The biggest change to the user API is the violation of the inheritance order,
due to the introduction of abstract types, so this release is a major one.

### Changes

* There are a lot of changes in the structure of the library,
  due to the widespread use of typing.
* `aio_pika.abc` module now contains all types and abstract class prototypes.
* Modern `aiormq~=6.1.1` used.
* Complete type checks coverage via mypy.
* The interface of `aio_pika`'s classes has undergone minimal changes,
  but you should double-check your code before migrating, at least because
  almost all types are now in `aio_pika.abc`. Module `aio_pika.types`
  still exists, but will produce a `DeprecationWarning`.
* Default value for argument `weak` is changed to `False` in
  `CallbackCollection.add(func, weak=False)`.


### Known 6.x to 7.x migration issues

* `pamqp.specification` module didn't exist in `pamqp==3.0.1` so you have to
  change it:
  * `pamqp.commands` for AMPQ-RPCâ€“relates classes
  * `pamqp.base` for `Frame` class
  * `pamqp.body` for `ContentBody` class
  * `pamqp.commands` for `Basic`, `Channel`, `Confirm`, `Exchange`,
    `Queue`, `Tx` classes.
  * `pamqp.common` for `FieldArray`, `FieldTable`, `FieldValue` classes
  * `pamqp.constants` for constants like `REPLY_SUCCESS`.
  * `pamqp.header` for `ContentHeader` class.
  * `pamqp.heartbeat` for `Heartbeat` class.
* Type definitions related to imports from `aio_pika` might throw warnings
  like `'SomeType' is not declared in __all__ `. This is a normal situation,
  since now it is necessary to import types from `aio_pika.abc`. In this
  release, these are just warnings, but in the next major release, this will
  stop working, so you should take care of changes in your code.

  Just use `aio_pika.abc` in your imports.

  The list of deprecated imports:
  * `from aio_pika.message import ReturnCallback`
  * `from aio_pika.patterns.rpc import RPCMessageType` - renamed to
    `RPCMessageTypes`
  * `import aio_pika.types` - module deprecated use `aio_pika.abc` instead
  * `from aio_pika.connection import ConnectionType`
